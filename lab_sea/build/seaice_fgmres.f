CEOP

C CPP flags controlling particular source code features

C-- Forcing code options:

C o Shortwave heating as extra term in external_forcing.F
C Note: this should be a run-time option

C o Include/exclude Geothermal Heat Flux at the bottom of the ocean

C o Allow to account for heating due to friction (and momentum dissipation)

C o Allow mass source or sink of Fluid in the interior
C   (3-D generalisation of oceanic real-fresh water flux)

C o Include pressure loading code

C o Include/exclude balancing surface forcing fluxes code

C o Include/exclude balancing surface forcing relaxation code

C o Include/exclude checking for negative salinity

C-- Options to discard parts of the main code:

C o Exclude/allow external forcing-fields load
C   this allows to read & do simple linear time interpolation of oceanic
C   forcing fields, if no specific pkg (e.g., EXF) is used to compute them.
C   If defined, use same method (with pkg/autodiff compiled or not) for checking
C   when to load new reccord ; by default, use simpler method with pkg/autodiff.

C o Include/exclude phi_hyd calculation code

C o Include/exclude sound speed calculation code
C o (Note that this is a diagnostic from Del Grasso algorithm, not derived
C    from EOS)

C-- Vertical mixing code options:

C o Include/exclude calling S/R CONVECTIVE_ADJUSTMENT

C o Include/exclude calling S/R CONVECTIVE_ADJUSTMENT_INI, turned off by
C   default because it is an unpopular historical left-over

C o Include/exclude call to S/R CALC_DIFFUSIVITY

C o Allow full 3D specification of vertical diffusivity

C o Allow latitudinally varying BryanLewis79 vertical diffusivity

C o Exclude/allow partial-cell effect (physical or enhanced) in vertical mixing
C   this allows to account for partial-cell in vertical viscosity and diffusion,
C   either from grid-spacing reduction effect or as artificially enhanced mixing
C   near surface & bottom for too thin grid-cell

C o Exclude/allow to use isotropic 3-D Smagorinsky viscosity as diffusivity
C   for tracers (after scaling by constant Prandtl number)

C-- Time-stepping code options:

C o Include/exclude combined Surf.Pressure and Drag Implicit solver code

C o Include/exclude Implicit vertical advection code

C o Include/exclude AdamsBashforth-3rd-Order code

C o Include/exclude Quasi-Hydrostatic Stagger Time-step AdamsBashforth code

C-- Model formulation options:

C o Allow/exclude "Exact Convervation" of fluid in Free-Surface formulation
C   that ensures that d/dt(eta) is exactly equal to - Div.Transport

C o Allow the use of Non-Linear Free-Surface formulation
C   this implies that grid-cell thickness (hFactors) varies with time
C o Disable code for rStar coordinate and/or code for Sigma coordinate
c#define DISABLE_RSTAR_CODE
c#define DISABLE_SIGMA_CODE

C o Include/exclude nonHydrostatic code

C o Include/exclude GM-like eddy stress in momentum code

C-- Algorithm options:

C o Include/exclude code for Non Self-Adjoint (NSA) conjugate-gradient solver

C o Include/exclude code for single reduction Conjugate-Gradient solver

C o Choices for implicit solver routines solve_*diagonal.F
C   The following has low memory footprint, but not suitable for AD
C   The following one suitable for AD but does not vectorize

C   Implementation alternative (might be faster on some platforms ?)

C-- Retired code options:

C o ALLOW isotropic scaling of harmonic and bi-harmonic terms when
C   using an locally isotropic spherical grid with (dlambda) x (dphi*cos(phi))
C *only for use on a lat-lon grid*
C   Setting this flag here affects both momentum and tracer equation unless
C   it is set/unset again in other header fields (e.g., GAD_OPTIONS.h).
C   The definition of the flag is commented to avoid interference with
C   such other header files.
C   The preferred method is specifying a value for viscAhGrid or viscA4Grid
C   in data which is then automatically scaled by the grid size;
C   the old method of specifying viscAh/viscA4 and this flag is provided
C   for completeness only (and for use with the adjoint).
c#define ISOTROPIC_COS_SCALING

C o This flag selects the form of COSINE(lat) scaling of bi-harmonic term.
C *only for use on a lat-lon grid*
C   Has no effect if ISOTROPIC_COS_SCALING is undefined.
C   Has no effect on vector invariant momentum equations.
C   Setting this flag here affects both momentum and tracer equation unless
C   it is set/unset again in other header fields (e.g., GAD_OPTIONS.h).
C   The definition of the flag is commented to avoid interference with
C   such other header files.
c#define COSINEMETH_III

C o Use LONG.bin, LATG.bin, etc., initialization for ini_curviliear_grid.F
C   Default is to use "new" grid files (OLD_GRID_IO undef) but OLD_GRID_IO
C   is still useful with, e.g., single-domain curvilinear configurations.

C-- Other option files:

C o Execution environment support options

CBOP
C     !ROUTINE: CPP_EEOPTIONS.h
C     !INTERFACE:
C     include "CPP_EEOPTIONS.h"
C
C     !DESCRIPTION:
C     *==========================================================*
C     | CPP\_EEOPTIONS.h                                         |
C     *==========================================================*
C     | C preprocessor "execution environment" supporting        |
C     | flags. Use this file to set flags controlling the        |
C     | execution environment in which a model runs - as opposed |
C     | to the dynamical problem the model solves.               |
C     | Note: Many options are implemented with both compile time|
C     |       and run-time switches. This allows options to be   |
C     |       removed altogether, made optional at run-time or   |
C     |       to be permanently enabled. This convention helps   |
C     |       with the data-dependence analysis performed by the |
C     |       adjoint model compiler. This data dependency       |
C     |       analysis can be upset by runtime switches that it  |
C     |       is unable to recoginise as being fixed for the     |
C     |       duration of an integration.                        |
C     |       A reasonable way to use these flags is to          |
C     |       set all options as selectable at runtime but then  |
C     |       once an experimental configuration has been        |
C     |       identified, rebuild the code with the appropriate  |
C     |       options set at compile time.                       |
C     *==========================================================*
CEOP

C     In general the following convention applies:
C     ALLOW  - indicates an feature will be included but it may
C     CAN      have a run-time flag to allow it to be switched
C              on and off.
C              If ALLOW or CAN directives are "undef'd" this generally
C              means that the feature will not be available i.e. it
C              will not be included in the compiled code and so no
C              run-time option to use the feature will be available.
C
C     ALWAYS - indicates the choice will be fixed at compile time
C              so no run-time option will be present

C=== Macro related options ===
C--   Control storage of floating point operands
C     On many systems it improves performance only to use
C     8-byte precision for time stepped variables.
C     Constant in time terms ( geometric factors etc.. )
C     can use 4-byte precision, reducing memory utilisation and
C     boosting performance because of a smaller working set size.
C     However, on vector CRAY systems this degrades performance.
C     Enable to switch REAL4_IS_SLOW from genmake2 (with LET_RS_BE_REAL4):

C--   Control use of "double" precision constants.
C     Use D0 where it means REAL*8 but not where it means REAL*16

C=== IO related options ===
C--   Flag used to indicate whether Fortran formatted write
C     and read are threadsafe. On SGI the routines can be thread
C     safe, on Sun it is not possible - if you are unsure then
C     undef this option.

C--   Flag used to indicate whether Binary write to Local file (i.e.,
C     a different file for each tile) and read are thread-safe.

C--   Flag to turn off the writing of error message to ioUnit zero

C--   Alternative formulation of BYTESWAP, faster than
C     compiler flag -byteswapio on the Altix.

C--   Flag to turn on old default of opening scratch files with the
C     STATUS='SCRATCH' option. This method, while perfectly FORTRAN-standard,
C     caused filename conflicts on some multi-node/multi-processor platforms
C     in the past and has been replace by something (hopefully) more robust.

C--   Flag defined for eeboot_minimal.F, eeset_parms.F and open_copy_data_file.F
C     to write STDOUT, STDERR and scratch files from process 0 only.
C WARNING: to use only when absolutely confident that the setup is working
C     since any message (error/warning/print) from any proc <> 0 will be lost.

C=== MPI, EXCH and GLOBAL_SUM related options ===
C--   Flag turns off MPI_SEND ready_to_receive polling in the
C     gather_* subroutines to speed up integrations.

C--   Control MPI based parallel processing
CXXX We no longer select the use of MPI via this file (CPP_EEOPTIONS.h)
CXXX To use MPI, use an appropriate genmake2 options file or use
CXXX genmake2 -mpi .
CXXX #undef  ALLOW_USE_MPI

C--   Control use of communication that might overlap computation.
C     Under MPI selects/deselects "non-blocking" sends and receives.
C--   Control use of communication that is atomic to computation.
C     Under MPI selects/deselects "blocking" sends and receives.

C--   Control XY periodicity in processor to grid mappings
C     Note: Model code does not need to know whether a domain is
C           periodic because it has overlap regions for every box.
C           Model assume that these values have been
C           filled in some way.

C--   disconnect tiles (no exchange between tiles, just fill-in edges
C     assuming locally periodic subdomain)

C--   Always cumulate tile local-sum in the same order by applying MPI allreduce
C     to array of tiles ; can get slower with large number of tiles (big set-up)

C--   Alternative way of doing global sum without MPI allreduce call
C     but instead, explicit MPI send & recv calls. Expected to be slower.

C--   Alternative way of doing global sum on a single CPU
C     to eliminate tiling-dependent roundoff errors. Note: This is slow.

C=== Other options (to add/remove pieces of code) ===
C--   Flag to turn on checking for errors from all threads and procs
C     (calling S/R STOP_IF_ERROR) before stopping.

C--   Control use of communication with other component:
C     allow to import and export from/to Coupler interface.

C--   Activate some pieces of code for coupling to GEOS AGCM

C=== And define Macros ===

C     In general the following convention applies:
C     ALLOW  - indicates an feature will be included but it may
C     CAN      have a run-time flag to allow it to be switched
C              on and off.
C              If ALLOW or CAN directives are "undef'd" this generally
C              means that the feature will not be available i.e. it
C              will not be included in the compiled code and so no
C              run-time option to use the feature will be available.
C
C     ALWAYS - indicates the choice will be fixed at compile time
C              so no run-time option will be present

C     Flag used to indicate which flavour of multi-threading
C     compiler directives to use. Only set one of these.
C     USE_SOLARIS_THREADING  - Takes directives for SUN Workshop
C                              compiler.
C     USE_KAP_THREADING      - Takes directives for Kuck and
C                              Associates multi-threading compiler
C                              ( used on Digital platforms ).
C     USE_IRIX_THREADING     - Takes directives for SGI MIPS
C                              Pro Fortran compiler.
C     USE_EXEMPLAR_THREADING - Takes directives for HP SPP series
C                              compiler.
C     USE_C90_THREADING      - Takes directives for CRAY/SGI C90
C                              system F90 compiler.






C--   Define the mapping for the _BARRIER macro
C     On some systems low-level hardware support can be accessed through
C     compiler directives here.

C--   Define the mapping for the BEGIN_CRIT() and  END_CRIT() macros.
C     On some systems we simply execute this section only using the
C     master thread i.e. its not really a critical section. We can
C     do this because we do not use critical sections in any critical
C     sections of our code!

C--   Define the mapping for the BEGIN_MASTER_SECTION() and
C     END_MASTER_SECTION() macros. These are generally implemented by
C     simply choosing a particular thread to be "the master" and have
C     it alone execute the BEGIN_MASTER..., END_MASTER.. sections.

CcnhDebugStarts
C      Alternate form to the above macros that increments (decrements) a counter each
C      time a MASTER section is entered (exited). This counter can then be checked in barrier
C      to try and detect calls to BARRIER within single threaded sections.
C      Using these macros requires two changes to Makefile - these changes are written
C      below.
C      1 - add a filter to the CPP command to kill off commented _MASTER lines
C      2 - add a filter to the CPP output the converts the string N EWLINE to an actual newline.
C      The N EWLINE needs to be changes to have no space when this macro and Makefile changes
C      are used. Its in here with a space to stop it getting parsed by the CPP stage in these
C      comments.
C      #define IF ( a .EQ. 1 ) THEN  IF ( a .EQ. 1 ) THEN  N EWLINE      CALL BARRIER_MS(a)
C      #define ENDIF    CALL BARRIER_MU(a) N EWLINE        ENDIF
C      'CPP = cat $< | $(TOOLSDIR)/set64bitConst.sh |  grep -v '^[cC].*_MASTER' | cpp  -traditional -P'
C      .F.f:
C      $(CPP) $(DEFINES) $(INCLUDES) |  sed 's/N EWLINE/\n/' > $@
CcnhDebugEnds

C--   Control storage of floating point operands
C     On many systems it improves performance only to use
C     8-byte precision for time stepped variables.
C     Constant in time terms ( geometric factors etc.. )
C     can use 4-byte precision, reducing memory utilisation and
C     boosting performance because of a smaller working
C     set size. However, on vector CRAY systems this degrades
C     performance.
C- Note: global_sum/max macros were used to switch to  JAM routines (obsolete);
C  in addition, since only the R4 & R8 S/R are coded, GLOBAL RS & RL macros
C  enable to call the corresponding R4 or R8 S/R.



C- Note: a) exch macros were used to switch to  JAM routines (obsolete)
C        b) exch R4 & R8 macros are not practically used ; if needed,
C           will directly call the corrresponding S/R.

C--   Control use of JAM routines for Artic network (no longer supported)
C     These invoke optimized versions of "exchange" and "sum" that
C     utilize the programmable aspect of Artic cards.
CXXX No longer supported ; started to remove JAM routines.
CXXX #ifdef LETS_MAKE_JAM
CXXX #define CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8 ( a, b) CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8_JAM ( a, b)
CXXX #define CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8 ( a, b ) CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XY_RS ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XY_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XY_RL ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XY_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XYZ_RS ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XYZ_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XYZ_RL ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XYZ_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #endif

C--   Control use of "double" precision constants.
C     Use d0 where it means REAL*8 but not where it means REAL*16

C--   Substitue for 1.D variables
C     Sun compilers do not use 8-byte precision for literals
C     unless .Dnn is specified. CRAY vector machines use 16-byte
C     precision when they see .Dnn which runs very slowly!

C--   Set the format for writing processor IDs, e.g. in S/R eeset_parms
C     and S/R open_copy_data_file. The default of I9.9 should work for
C     a long time (until we will use 10e10 processors and more)

C--   Set the format for writing ensemble task IDs in S/R eeset_parms
C     and S/R open_copy_data_file.

C--   Set ACTION= in OPEN instruction for input file (before doing IO)
C     leave it empty (if EXCLUDE_OPEN_ACTION) or set it to proper value



C o Include/exclude single header file containing multiple packages options
C   (AUTODIFF, COST, CTRL, ECCO, EXF ...) instead of the standard way where
C   each of the above pkg get its own options from its specific option file.
C   Although this method, inherited from ECCO setup, has been traditionally
C   used for all adjoint built, work is in progress to allow to use the
C   standard method also for adjoint built.

C     *==========================================================*
C     | SEAICE_OPTIONS.h
C     | o CPP options file for sea ice package.
C     *==========================================================*
C     | Use this file for selecting options within the sea ice
C     | package.
C     *==========================================================*

C---  Package-specific Options & Macros go here

C--   Write "text-plots" of certain fields in STDOUT for debugging.

C--   By default, the sea-ice package uses its own integrated bulk
C     formulae to compute fluxes (fu, fv, EmPmR, Qnet, and Qsw) over
C     open-ocean.  When this flag is set, these variables are computed
C     in a separate external package, for example, pkg/exf, and then
C     modified for sea-ice effects by pkg/seaice.

C--   This CPP flag has been retired.  The number of ice categories
C     used to solve for seaice flux is now specified by run-time
C     parameter SEAICE_multDim.
C     Note: be aware of pickup_seaice.* compatibility issues when
C     restarting a simulation with a different number of categories.
c#define SEAICE_MULTICATEGORY

C--   run with sea Ice Thickness Distribution (ITD);
C     set number of categories (nITD) in SEAICE_SIZE.h

C--   Since the missing sublimation term is now included
C     this flag is needed for backward compatibility

C--   Suspected missing term in coupled ocn-ice heat budget (to be confirmed)

C--   Default is constant seaice salinity (SEAICE_salt0); Define the following
C     flag to consider (space & time) variable salinity: advected and forming
C     seaice with a fraction (=SEAICE_saltFrac) of freezing seawater salinity.
C- Note: SItracer also offers an alternative way to handle variable salinity.

C--   Enable grease ice parameterization (requires to define ALLOW_SITRACER):
C     The grease ice parameterization delays formation of solid sea ice from
C     frazil ice by a time constant and provides a dynamic calculation of the
C     initial solid sea ice thickness HO as a function of winds, currents and
C     available grease ice volume. Grease ice does not significantly reduce heat
C     loss from the ocean in winter and area covered by grease is thus handled
C     like open water (For details see Smedsrud and Martin, 2014, Ann.Glac.).
C     Set SItrName(1) = 'grease' in namelist SEAICE_PARM03 in data.seaice
C     then output SItr01 is SItrNameLong(1) = 'grease ice volume fraction',
C     with SItrUnit(1) = '[0-1]', which needs to be multiplied by SIheff to
C     yield grease ice volume. Additionally, the actual grease ice layer
C     thickness (diagnostic SIgrsLT) can be saved.

C--   Tracers of ice and/or ice cover.
C-    To try avoid 'spontaneous generation' of tracer maxima by advdiff.

C-    Include code to diagnose sea ice tracer budgets in
C     seaice_advdiff.F and seaice_tracer_phys.F. Diagnostics are
C     computed the "call diagnostics_fill" statement is commented out.

C--   Allow sea-ice dynamic code. These options are provided so that,
C     if turned off (#undef), to compile (and process with TAF) only the
C     the thermodynamics component of the code. Note that, if needed,
C     sea-ice dynamics can be turned off at runtime (SEAICEuseDYNAMICS=F).

C--   Historically, the seaice model was discretized on a B-Grid. This
C     discretization should still work but it is not longer actively
C     tested and supported. Define this flag to compile it. It cannot be
C     defined together with SEAICE_CGRID

C--   The following flag should always be set in order to use C the
C--   operational C-grid discretization.

C--   Options for the C-grid version only:

C     enable advection of sea ice momentum

C     enable JFNK code by defining the following flag

C     enable Krylov code by defining the following flag

C--   Use a different order when mapping 2D velocity arrays to 1D vector
C     before passing it to FGMRES.

C     to reproduce old verification results for JFNK

C     enable LSR to use global (multi-tile) tri-diagonal solver

C     enable EVP code by defining the following flag
C-    When set use SEAICE_zetaMin and SEAICE_evpDampC to limit viscosities
C     from below and above in seaice_evp: not necessary, and not recommended

C     Include code to avoid underflows in EVP-code (copied from CICE).
C     Many compilers can handle this more efficiently with the help of a flag.

C     Include code to print residual of EVP iteration for debugging/diagnostics

C     smooth regularization (without max-function) of delta for
C     better differentiability

C     regularize zeta to zmax with a smooth tanh-function instead
C     of a min(zeta,zmax). This improves convergence of iterative
C     solvers (Lemieux and Tremblay 2009, JGR). No effect on EVP

C--   Different yield curves within the VP rheology framework
C     allow the truncated ellipse rheology (runtime flag SEAICEuseTEM)

C     allow the use of the Mohr Coulomb rheology (runtime flag SEAICEuseMCS)
C     as defined in (Ip 1991) /!\ This is known to give unstable results,
C     use with caution

C     allow the use of Mohr Coulomb with elliptical plastic potential
C     (runtime flag SEAICEuseMCE)

C     allow the teardrop and parabolic lens  rheology
C     (runtime flag SEAICEuseTD and SEAICEusePL)

C--   LSR solver settings
C     Use LSR vector code; not useful on non-vector machines, because it
C     slows down convergence considerably, but the extra iterations are
C     more than made up by the much faster code on vector machines. For
C     the only regularly test vector machine these flags a specified
C     in the build options file SUPER-UX_SX-8_sxf90_awi, so that we comment
C     them out here.

C     Use zebra-method (alternate lines) for line-successive-relaxation
C     This modification improves the convergence of the vector code
C     dramatically, so that is may actually be useful in general, but
C     that needs to be tested. Can be used without vectorization options.

C     Include code to print residual of nonlinear outer loop of LSR

C     This flag is also required for an actual adjoint of seaice_lsr;
C     increases memory requirements a lot.

C     Use parameterisation of grounding ice for a better representation
C     of fastice in shallow seas



C--   Some regularisations
C-    When set limit the Ice-Loading to mass of 1/5 of Surface ocean grid-box

C-    When set use SEAICE_clipVelocties = .true., to clip U/VICE at 40cm/s,
C     not recommended

C-    When set cap the sublimation latent heat flux in solve4temp according
C     to the available amount of ice+snow. Otherwise this term is treated
C     like all of the others -- residuals heat and fw stocks are passed to
C     the ocean at the end of seaice_growth in a conservative manner.
C     SEAICE_CAP_SUBLIM is not needed as of now, but kept just in case.

C--   AD flags
C-    TAF related flag, currently only used in seaice_ad_check_lev[1-4]_dir.h;
C     it is unclear if this is ever needed.

C-    Reset fields to zero to stabilise AD code of dynamics solver
C     (resulting in wrong gradients)

C-    Another flag to simplify dependencies for TAF-generated AD-code
C     the thermodynamic part, mostly by resetting variables to zero

C-    Special seaice flag for AD testing

C--   Use the adjointable sea-ice thermodynamic model
C     in seaice_growth_adx.F instead of seaice_growth.F
C     This options excludes more complex physics such
C     as sublimation, ITD, and frazil.

C--   These flags are not strictly AD-related but may help obtaining
C     simpler AD-code:
C-    Do not compile code that resets AREA (or AREAITD) to a mininum value
C     of SEAICE_area_floor (=SIeps with default of 1e-5) if there is
C     some finite sea ice thickness

C-    Do not compile growth/thermodynamics code (avoiding this code can
C     also be done by setting runtime parameter usePWthermodynamics=F)

C-    Do not compile/use seaice-related obcs code when using obcs.

C MITgcm standards:
C f90 -> F
C !-comment -> C-comment
C add its to list of arguments
C double precision -> Real*8
C implicit none
C
C jfl Dec 1st 2006. We modified the routine so that it is double precison.
C Here are the modifications:
C 1) implicit real (a-h,o-z) becomes implicit real*8 (a-h,o-z)
C 2) real bocomes real*8
C 3) subroutine scopy.f has been changed for dcopy.f
C 4) subroutine saxpy.f has been changed for daxpy.f
C 5) function sdot.f has been changed for ddot.f
C 6) 1e-08 becomes 1d-08
C
C Be careful with the dcopy, daxpy and ddot code...there is a slight
C difference with the single precision versions (scopy, saxpy and sdot).
C In the single precision versions, the array are declared sightly differently.
C It is written for single precision:

C flexible GMRES routine. This is a version of GMRES which allows a
C a variable preconditioner. Implemented with a reverse communication
C protocole for flexibility -
C DISTRIBUTED VERSION (USES DISTDOT FOR DDOT)
C explicit (exact) residual norms for restarts
C written by Y. Saad, modified by A. Malevsky, version February 1, 1995
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C This Is A Reverse Communication Implementation.
C-------------------------------------------------
C USAGE: (see also comments for icode below). FGMRES
C should be put in a loop and the loop should be active for as
C long as icode is not equal to 0. On return fgmres will
C    1) either be requesting the new preconditioned vector applied
C       to wk1 in case icode.eq.1 (result should be put in wk2)
C    2) or be requesting the product of A applied to the vector wk1
C       in case icode.eq.2 (result should be put in wk2)
C    3) or be terminated in case icode .eq. 0.
C on entry always set icode = 0. So icode should be set back to zero
C upon convergence.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Here is a typical way of running fgmres:
C
C      icode = 0
C 1    continue
C      call fgmres (n,im,rhs,sol,i,vv,w,wk1,wk2,eps,maxits,iout,
C     &             icode,its,mythid)
C
C      if (icode .eq. 1) then
C         call  precon(n, wk1, wk2)    <--- user variable preconditioning
C         goto 1
C      else if (icode .ge. 2) then
C         call  matvec (n,wk1, wk2)    <--- user matrix vector product.
C         goto 1
C      else
C         ----- done ----
C         .........

C
C n     == integer. the dimension of the problem
C im    == size of Krylov subspace:  should not exceed 50 in this
C          version (can be reset in code. looking at comment below)
C rhs   == vector of length n containing the right hand side
C sol   == initial guess on input, approximate solution on output
C vv    == work space of size n x (im+1)
C w     == work space of length n x im
C wk1,
C wk2,  == two work vectors of length n each used for the reverse
C          communication protocole. When on return (icode .ne. 1)
C          the user should call fgmres again with wk2 = precon * wk1
C          and icode untouched. When icode.eq.1 then it means that
C          convergence has taken place.
C
C eps   == tolerance for stopping criterion. process is stopped
C          as soon as ( ||.|| is the euclidean norm):
C          || current residual||/||initial residual|| <= eps
C
C maxits== maximum number of iterations allowed
C
C i     == internal iteration counter, updated in this routine
C its   == current (Krylov) iteration counter, updated in this routine
C
C iout  == output unit number number for printing intermediate results
C          if (iout .le. 0) no statistics are printed.
C
C icode = integer. indicator for the reverse communication protocole.
C         ON ENTRY : icode should be set to icode = 0.
C         ON RETURN:
C       * icode .eq. 1 value means that fgmres has not finished
C         and that it is requesting a preconditioned vector before
C         continuing. The user must compute M**(-1) wk1, where M is
C         the preconditioing  matrix (may vary at each call) and wk1 is
C         the vector as provided by fgmres upun return, and put the
C         result in wk2. Then fgmres must be called again without
C         changing any other argument.
C       * icode .eq. 2 value means that fgmres has not finished
C         and that it is requesting a matrix vector product before
C         continuing. The user must compute  A * wk1, where A is the
C         coefficient  matrix and wk1 is the vector provided by
C         upon return. The result of the operation is to be put in
C         the vector wk2. Then fgmres must be called again without
C         changing any other argument.
C       * icode .eq. 0 means that fgmres has finished and sol contains
C         the approximate solution.
C         comment: typically fgmres must be implemented in a loop
C         with fgmres being called as long icode is returned with
C         a value .ne. 0.
